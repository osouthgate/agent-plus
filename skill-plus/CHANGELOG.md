# skill-plus — changelog

All notable changes to this plugin.

Format: one entry per change, most recent first. Date format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-30

Initial release. The fifth universal primitive of the agent-plus framework — alongside `agent-plus`, `repo-analyze`, `diff-summary`, `skill-feedback`. Replaces the "I keep typing this same command" → "I should turn this into a skill" gap with one structured mining loop.

### Added
- **`scan`** — single-pass session-log miner. Walks `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl`, defensively recurses through tool-use envelopes to find every `Bash` invocation, clusters by first-three-tokens, applies a denylist (`git`, `ls`, `grep`, `cat`, etc — routine noise) plus an allowlist override (anything carrying `--service`, `--env`, `--project`, `--deployment`, or an `mcp__*` tool name keeps through). Threshold defaults: `min_count=3`, `min_sessions=2`. Persists to `<git-toplevel>/.agent-plus/skill-plus/candidates.jsonl` with sha1-keyed dedupe and atomic `.tmp` rewrite. Last-scan watermark in `last-scan.txt` for incremental delta scans.
- **`propose`** — read+rank surface over `candidates.jsonl`. Score = `count + 0.5 * distinct_sessions + recency_boost (max(0, 7 - days_since_lastSeen))`. Augments each row with `proposedSkillName` (slug derived from first non-flag token), `daysSinceLastSeen`, `existing` (does `.claude/skills/<name>/` already exist), and `kind: "new" | "enhance"`.
- **`install-cron`** — cross-platform self-installer for scheduled `scan --accept-consent`. POSIX uses `crontab` with marker-line idempotency; Windows uses `schtasks` with sanitized task name + exit-code-based reinstall detection (locale-independent — no English-only stderr matching). `--print-only` emits the planned entry without writing; `--uninstall` is idempotent. Consent for cron is captured at install time — cron writes only inside `~/.agent-plus/skill-plus/` and the project's `.agent-plus/skill-plus/` tree.
- **`scaffold <name>`** — writes `.claude/skills/<name>/{SKILL.md, bin/<name>, bin/<name>.cmd, bin/<name>.py}` matching the agent-plus framework contract. Non-skippable required slots: `description` (≥10 chars), `when_to_use` (≥10 chars), `## Killer command` (≥5 chars), at least one `## Do NOT use this for` bullet. Slots can be CLI flags or `--from-candidate <id>` to seed the killer command from a mined pattern. Generated `.py` is self-contained, stdlib-only, ships envelope helpers + redactor + layered env resolver (`--env-file` → `<repo>/.env.local` → `<repo>/.env` → `~/.agent-plus/.env` → shell). Refuses to overwrite an existing skill unless `--force`.
- **`list`** — read-only audit of `.claude/skills/*/` against the contract. Hand-rolled stdlib frontmatter parser (no pyyaml). Lenient on key spelling (`when_to_use` / `when-to-use` / `whenToUse` all accepted). Per-skill checks: frontmatter completeness, body sections present (`## Killer command`, `## Do NOT use this for` / `## When NOT to use`, `## Safety rules`), POSIX + Windows launchers present, stdlib-only imports (advisory). Sorted worst-first so the worst-scoring skills surface first.
- **`feedback`** — cross-source aggregator joining (1) `<git-toplevel>/.agent-plus/skill-feedback/<skill>.jsonl` ratings and (2) implicit session-mining failure signals: plugin invocation followed by manual fallback within 10 tool calls, plugin re-invoked within 5 calls, raw command pattern that should have been a plugin invocation but wasn't (discoverability gap). Threshold of 5 invocations to avoid noise. Read-only — never writes either log. Stream 2 gated by consent.
- **`promote <name>`** — moves a project-local skill to a `<user>/agent-plus-skills` marketplace clone. Validates against the contract (frontmatter, `## Killer command`, non-empty `obviates` from frontmatter or body section). Reads + writes the **live marketplace shape** — `{name, owner, version, agent_plus_version, surface, skills: [{name, version, path, obviates}]}` — preserving canonical key order and any unknown top-level keys. Dry-run by default; `--no-dry-run` copies the directory tree, mutates `marketplace.json#skills`, removes source unless `--keep-local`. Refuses if destination already lists a skill of that name.
- **Envelope contract.** Every subcommand emits `tool: {name, version}` top-level. `--output PATH` writes the full payload to disk and returns a compact summary (`payloadPath`, `bytes`, `payloadKeys`, `payloadShape`). `--shape-depth 1|2|3` controls payload-shape recursion (default 3). Matches the `repo-analyze` / `diff-summary` / `skill-feedback` shape exactly.
- **Privacy gates.** Scan refuses without `--accept-consent` (or prior consent grant) unless interactive consent has been recorded; per-project consent persisted to `~/.agent-plus/skill-plus/consent.json`. Cross-project mining (`--all-projects`) opt-in. Secret redaction patterns cover GitHub PATs, AWS, Anthropic, Langfuse, Stripe, OpenAI-style, OpenRouter, Supabase, Sentry, Google, Slack tokens + webhooks, Discord bot tokens + webhooks, JWTs, Bearer, Authorization, connection strings, and `--token`/`--password`/`--secret` argv pairs — applied **before** any candidate is written to disk.
- **83 unit tests** across foundation (envelope shape, storage resolution, secret scrubber, encoded-cwd format), scan (8), propose (8), install-cron (17), scaffold (13), list (8), feedback (7), promote (13).

### Deliberately out of scope (deferred)
- v1 argument normalization (`railway logs --service api --since 5m` collides with `railway logs --since 10m --service api` under v0).
- v2 sequence detection (n-grams of ordered tool calls for wrapper-skill candidates).
- MCP-tool clustering (separate from Bash for now).
- Telemetry sharing — local-only is a feature.
- Interactive consent prompt for first-run scan (currently flag-only via `--accept-consent`; interactive mode lands when `propose` gets its full TUI).
